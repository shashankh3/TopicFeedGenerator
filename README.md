Common Issues
Extension not working? Verify you're on youtube.com (not youtube.music.com), check that Developer Mode is enabled, and reload the extension in chrome://extensions.

No videos appearing? Ensure topics are added in the dashboard, try more specific/popular topic terms, and check browser console for error messages.

UI looks broken? Clear browser cache and reload YouTube, disable other YouTube-related extensions temporarily, and check if YouTube's interface has updated.

Performance issues? Limit topics to 10 or fewer for optimal speed, clear extension cache by removing/re-adding topics, and restart browser if memory usage is high.

Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by opening browser console on YouTube:

javascript
// Check if extension loaded
console.log(window.topicFeedManager);

// View current topics
chrome.storage.local.get(['topics'], console.log);
